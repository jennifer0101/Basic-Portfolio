            <p>I am currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota's coding bootcamp for full stack web development.
                After doing a variety of volunteer and paid work, as well as attending college for two semesters
                while being a stay at home parent, I have decided to re-enter the workforce as a web developer.</p>

            <p>I am creative, detail-oriented, and enjoy troubleshooting. I really enjoy the challenging, yet satisfying
                world of coding.</p>

            <p>When not learning code, I like to go for walks by the river, snap photos of things that interest me,
                create art, and connect with friends.</p>
